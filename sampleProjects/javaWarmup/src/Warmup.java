/**
 * A set of static methods you need to implement for this Java warmup.
 * These method all involve integer parameters, and many require you to perform
 * operations such as division and reminder. Using bit operations (shifting and
 * masking) is useful for several, although not strictly needed. 
 * 
 * <p>Make your changes in this file. Do not change the method names or arguments. 
 * If you do, the tests will fail.
 * 
 * <p>In each method, replace the "throw new Unsupported..." statement with your
 * implementation. Those throw statements are there to indicate which functions
 * you haven't gotten around to implementing yet.
