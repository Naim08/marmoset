To compile the SubmitServer code base, you must download the Java 2
Enterprise Edition (J2EE) SDK.  Only J2EE version 1.4 has been tested;
versions later than 1.4 may not work or could produce unexpected
behavior.  You can download the J2EE v1.4 SDK from
<http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/previous_j2ee/>.
